* What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

> The main thing I learned  was it's necessary to set padding to 0 on the left to get a horizontal list to work without extra space. Also, within that, that borders don't go precisely how you would think.

* What did you learn about CSS positioning?

> That without care, elements can easily end up overlapping. I put a lot of positioning elements in and took them out.

* What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

> Easiest: Text in the blog, changing fonts and adding some padding. Hardest: That horizontal menu on the top.


* What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

> I learned how to format elements within a class or id really well- I had misunderstood the terminology before. I learned the importance of inline display. I also learned that I need to leave enough time to deal with color elements. I didn't time box that at all. I also learned how to use Chrome DevTools to test formatting out before applying it in the live version.
