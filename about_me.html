      <h3>Bio Sketch</h3>
      <p>I was born in Princeton NJ, but moved out after 3 months on the grounds that it was Princeton New Jersey. From there my childhood took me on a whirlwind tour of the continental United States, including Madison, San Diego, the Berkshires, and Ohio. I went to college at Oberlin, where I was an English major. I've worked as a database developer, a IT Manager and an encyclopedia editor. I am not a relative of the wealthy Rothschilds, but never get tired of answering that question. </p>
