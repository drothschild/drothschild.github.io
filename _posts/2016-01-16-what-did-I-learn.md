I guess I can classify what I did learn in several different ways. There are specific techniques I learned, like CSS. There are things that I learned how difficult they are, like positioning elements in CSS. And there are things that I learned about myself: that technical writing was harder than I thought.

I don't think I'll ever be a web designer. Looking at other people's sites, they have more of a visual sense than I do about what works and what doesn't. The best visual thing I've done for my site is the splash of color across the top menu, and along the way I lost the complementary color. The second best thing I've did was keep the basic format of the Jekyll site.
