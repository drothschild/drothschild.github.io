<!-- Reflections
How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
I found it very smooth and easy to do, though I had done the wireframe initially on my own.


Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

I wouldn't work without in the future. Once I let go of the idea of the wireframe being good looking or anything but the simplest possible representation of the page, it was easy to put together.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

Simplicity was the key, with a lot of whitespace. We each used different wireframing services, though I ended up preferring his service.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I mostly learned up of the semantic elements for the next assignment, which I did first (though now the two don't match up, so I have to revise.)
