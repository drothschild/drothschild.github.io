    <h2>Classes vs. IDs</h2>
    <h3>What's the best practice?</h3>

    <p>Classes and IDs are essential parts of CSS, because they can be used to label any element of a web page as special, to be formatted differently than the other divs or spans or ps or lis. The key difference between a Class and an ID can be gleaned from their names. IDs can only be used for one person. However a number of people can be fall under the same classification (or if you prefer, can attend the same class.) You can use class multiple times in an HTML document. However ID can only be used onee instance on a page.</p>
    <p>So your ids should only be used for fine-grained control of something that you're only using once. If there's even a chance that you could be using it a second time, use a class instead. That's not to say you should never use IDs. It's sometimes important to indicate some element of your document <em>is</em> unique and is not be repeated elsewhere. </p>
